If you change the backend configuration, Terraform may prompt you to migrate the existing state to the new backend.

If you modify resource configurations, Terraform will update the infrastructure to match the new configuration, and the state file will be updated accordingly.

Terraform ensures that the state file accurately reflects the current state of your infrastructure, regardless of any changes made to your configuration.
